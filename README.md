<h1><b>Waste Image Based Recognition System</b></h1>
<li>
The system consist of 2 model which came from using the transfer learning technique where simply means using pre built model that has been trained while this is used for custom input such as waste images the 2 models are Yolov4 and InceptionV3 </li>

<li>
The Yolov4 function is to indetify waste inside the image and crop it

<li>
While for the InceptionV3 is to indetify the crop image that is send from Yolov4 itself

<li>
The Gui for it is simple GUI using tinker library 

<li>
By choosing the image the model will automatically show the waste and the identification below it
